# Salary Calculator



## Description
Duration: 15hrs

The purpose of this project is to add the salaries of multiple employees and to calculate the monthly cost based on this total. Additionally provide input fields for their first-name, last-name, id, title, and anual-salary. When a submit button is pressed, the user input in the above fields should be taken and converted into a row of information that is placed into a table. If the monthly total exceeds $20,000, then the background of this element will turn red. If the monthly total falls below $20,000, then its background will be reset to white.

I solved these problems by first creating a html file with all my needed elements, styling it with css to get the basic structure, and then implementing javascript to handle dynamic html and css manipulation. It was a process of implementing features one at a time and then taking a step back to make sure everything fit cohessively before moving on to another feature.
